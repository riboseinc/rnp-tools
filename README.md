# rnp-tools

We can use this repo to aggregate things that shouldn't yet be in the main
rnp tree and development utilities that you think might benefit other team
members. You can also use the wiki as a place to document notes that
you would prefer to keep out of the source or the issue threads.

Feel free to move this repo or its contents if you would prefer it to be
directly under an employee's control. I'll transfer ownership on request.
